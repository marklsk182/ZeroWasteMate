    "When the ingredient 'red chili' and its freshness level of 'slightly unfresh' are detected, the system recommends one recipe: 'Sambal Belacan with Shrimp'. This is accurate, as the entire dataset only contains one recipe that can be used based on this ingredient and freshness level."

    "# 7.0 Key Findings and Limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key finding for Image Classification Model:**\n",
    "\n",
    "During the testing phase, I noticed that placing an ingredient on a white background in a well-lit area yields more accurate results compared to positioning it on a non-white background with poor lighting. This may be because ingredients that are not fresh tend to be darker or have a brownish color. Therefore, using a white background with good lighting is sensible for enhancing the accuracy of the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key finding for Recommendation System:**\n",
    "\n",
    "During the testing phase, I observed that filter-based recommendations performed better compared to those using Jaccard scores and cosine similarity. With the latter methods, the system often recommended recipes that could not be used because the detected ingredients were not found in the recipe list. However, the filter-based recommendation consistently provided the correct recipes that utilized all of the identified ingredients.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Limitations of Image Classification Model:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the time constraints of this project, I was only able to source a dataset of fresh ingredients online; there was no time to document the transition of ingredients from fresh to slightly unfresh and then to unfresh. This significant limitation impacted the model's performance, with the best accuracy being only 0.713 (achieved by EfficientNetB3). One key reason for the low model performance might be the lack of a dataset with various freshness levels for each ingredient.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, most of the ingredient images were taken from an online dataset, which means the size and physical appearance of these ingredients may differ from those we find in local supermarkets. Consequently, the model's performance may decline when tested with local ingredients.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# 7.1 Learning and Future Improvement\n",
    "\n",
    "**Learning from Image Augmentation and future improvements:**\n",
    "\n",
    "When augmenting images, try not to augment the same image more than three times for the training dataset, as it may lead to model bias. Always aim to include a greater variety in the images of the ingredients. Ensure a good spread of images with varying lighting conditions; for instance, include pictures of fresh tomatoes taken in well-lit areas as well as in poorly lit areas in the training dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Learning from Preprocessing Images for modelling and future improvements:**\n",
    "\n",
    "When using pre-built models from keras.applications, you have the option to use the preprocess_input function from the respective pre-built model that you are utilizing. However, using preprocess_input from the respective pre-built model might cause your model to perform worse during training. Therefore, you can opt to preprocess the data yourself. It is always recommended to first train the model using preprocess_input from the respective pre-built model; if it does not yield good results, then consider preprocessing the data on your own.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Learning from Building the model and future improvements:**\n",
    "\n",
    "After training the model, I noticed that using a heavier or larger model does not always yield the best accuracy. Heavier models require significant computing resources for training and also necessitate longer testing times. One area for improvement in modeling would be to select some lightweight and medium-weight models for training as well. \n",

    "# 7.2 Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, the ZeroWasteMate project, aimed at reducing food waste in Singapore, yielded valuable insights. Key findings include the superior performance of filter-based recommendations and the importance of image background and lighting in ingredient recognition. The project encountered limitations, notably in dataset diversity and model performance. Future improvements should focus on expanding the dataset and exploring lightweight models. Despite challenges, ZeroWasteMate represents a meaningful step towards environmentally sustainable food management, demonstrating the significant role of technology in ecological conservation.\n",
